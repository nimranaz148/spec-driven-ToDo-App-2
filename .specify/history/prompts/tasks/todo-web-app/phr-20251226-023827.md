## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

Execute /sp.tasks workflow to generate detailed task breakdown from implementation plan.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list with 105 tasks across 9 phases:

**Phase Structure:**
1. **Phase 1: Setup** (8 tasks) - Project initialization for frontend/backend
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (21 tasks) - Database, models, schemas, auth middleware, API client
3. **Phase 3: US1 - Auth** (20 tasks) - Registration, login, JWT tokens
4. **Phase 4: US2 - CRUD** (22 tasks) - Task create/read/update/delete
5. **Phase 5: US3 - Toggle** (6 tasks) - Task completion toggle
6. **Phase 6: US4 - Isolation** (3 tasks) - User data isolation
7. **Phase 7: US5 - UI** (10 tasks) - Responsive design, animations
8. **Phase 8: Integration** (8 tasks) - E2E and performance tests
9. **Phase 9: Polish** (7 tasks) - Documentation, cleanup, deployment

**Test Coverage:**
- 12 backend tests (pytest)
- 10 frontend tests (Jest)
- 5 E2E tests (Playwright)

**MVP Scope:** Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 = Auth + CRUD + Isolation

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 105 executable tasks with clear dependencies and parallelization
- 🧪 Tests: 27 test tasks included per constitution (80% backend, 70% frontend)
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created with full task breakdown
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to execute tasks sequentially
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
