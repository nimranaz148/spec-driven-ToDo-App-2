# Docker AI Management

## Quick Reference
This skill leverages Docker's AI capabilities (Gordon) or simulates them via Claude Code to manage containerization tasks. It assists in generating Dockerfiles, docker-compose configurations, and managing container lifecycles.

## Basic Setup
- Ensure Docker Desktop is installed.
- Enable Docker AI (Beta) if available for enhanced capabilities.

## Core Patterns

### 1. Generate Configurations
Create Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files optimized for the specific application stack.

### 2. Optimize Images
Analyze existing configurations to reduce image size and build time.

### 3. AI Troubleshooting
Use AI to diagnose build failures and runtime errors.

## Usage
- See `examples.md` for detailed commands.
- See `reference.md` for best practices and command references.
